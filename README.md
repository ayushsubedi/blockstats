# Blockstats
Blockstats collects Blockstack data that can be used to generate a statistical report. 
This report, for example, is used to feed data to https://theblockstats.com

The react app behind https://theblockstats.com can be found [here](https://github.com/vrepsys/blockstats-page)

Blockstats collects and timestamps data such as: names, subdomains, apps installed

Written in Python. There's no installation package, to run it you'll need to build it from the source code.

To learn more what it can do for you check out [blockstats_cli.py](blockstats_cli.py)
